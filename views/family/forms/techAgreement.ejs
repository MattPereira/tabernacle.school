    <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Tabernacle Technology Use Agreement - Student Use</h3>
    <p>
        Tabernacle School’s technology resources (All desktops, laptops, ipads, and portable technology devices including phones, local and network service and connectivity, and email) enable staff members to access and exchange information quickly and efficiently with other staff members, parents, students, and educational resources. When used properly, we believe these resources greatly enhance the school’s productivity and provide unlimited resources for education.
    </p>
    <p>
        This policy applies to all technology resources that are allowed on our campus, that are used by staff, students, parents, or visitors. This policy applies to all activities using any of the school’s accounts, subscriptions, or other technology services, such as voice mail, email, text messaging, that are conducted from any location on or off campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Tabernacle technology network encompasses all technology resources that are interconnected inside our firewall. All computer resources that are used to access the school’s network effectively become part of the Tabernacle electronic network and are therefore subject to the terms and conditions within this agreement.
    </p>

    <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Acceptable Uses</h3>
    <p>
        The computer network at Tabernacle has been configured to allow Internet access for educational purposes. These purposes may include teacher-led discovery, student research activities, and individual technology train-ing. Access to the Internet is filtered on-site to minimize the risk of students encountering disruptive content from inappropriate web sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tabernacle School uses a separate network for the students. The student network uses a whitelist of websites that allows student access only to the educational websites that Tabernacle School adds to the list. The staff network has a filter but does not restrict access to search engines, and is not an acceptable network for student use. All of our student devices are restricted to the student network.
    </p>
    <h6>The following uses apply to nework usage</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Students may access whitelist websites that the school has opened for student use.</li>
        <li>Students may use tech resources only when they have a specific assignment requiring their use or explicit permission from a teacher or librarian to do so.</li>
        <li>Student use of the Internet is contingent upon parental permission in the form of a signed copy of this Use Agreement Policy.</li>

        <li>Notify an adult immediately if you receive a message that may be inappropriate, or if you encounter any material that violates this Use Agreement Policy, or if you are unsure.</li>
