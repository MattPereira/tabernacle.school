                <h5>Preschool parent, 2019</h5>
                <p>“I couldn’t say enough great things about Tabernacle’s preschool program. I appreciate them so much and wish I could have them be my daughter’s teachers forever. They are the most loving, smart, kind hearted, caring teachers I have ever met. We are so blessed to have them in our kids lives! They are the very best.”</p>
                <h5>Third grade parent, 2019</h5>
                <p>“My child’s third grade teacher is incredible! She is caring, encouraging and supportive, while still holding high expectations to ensure the students are ready for 4th grade and beyond. With any question or concerns that I have had throughout the year, she is timely in her response with a wealth of knowledge and resources. Her help class has been such a lifesaver to my son, giving him the additional practice and encouragement on those more challenging concepts throughout the year. I have seen my son grow into a more confident learner and this is a huge thank you to his teacher and the safe learning environment she creates in her classroom.”</p>
                <h5>Middle school parent, 2016</h5>
                <p>“We feel blessed that two of our three children have attended Tabernacle. Knowing that the teachers care, that they can be themselves without a ‘direct worldly attack’, and that there are opportunities in leadership, sports, and a Christian walk are worth the sacrifices we make as parents for them to attend here. We appreciate all the Tabernacle offers their students, families, and staff.”</p>
