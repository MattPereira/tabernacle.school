She is caring, encouraging and supportive, while still holding high expectations to ensure the students are ready for 4th grade and beyond. With any question or concerns that I have had throughout the year, she is timely in her response with a wealth of knowledge and resources. Her help class has been such a lifesaver to my son, giving him the additional practice and encouragement on those more challenging concepts throughout the year. I have seen my son grow into a more confident learner and this is a huge thank you to his teacher and the safe learning environment she creates in her classroom.”</p>
