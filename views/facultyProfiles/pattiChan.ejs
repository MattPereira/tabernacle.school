                    My name is Patti Chan and I have been a part of the Tabernacle family for 31 years. I started in the front office and, in 1997, moved to our finance office.

                    Here are some of my favorite Bible verses:
                    <br>
                    2 Corinthians 5:21 “For God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”
                    <br>
                    Hebrews 4:15-16  “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One in who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.  Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in the time of need.”
