                    I am the proud mother of two amazing children who have blessed me beyond measure and have been married to my wonderful husband David for 32 years. This past year I received the most precious of promotions to grandma.

                    I received my bachelor’s degree from Christian Heritage College and have been teaching kindergarten at Tabernacle for 25 years.  I have the best job in the world! Every day is full of joy, laughter and learning.  A verse I love is Psalm 34:8  “Taste and see that the Lord is good.  Oh, the joys of those who trust him!”  I will always be humbled that God chose me to teach His most precious treasures.
