                    I was born and raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the age of four, I started playing piano. Thru out my school age years, I enjoyed music through singing, playing piano, and acting in plays. I knew in high school that I wanted to pursue a degree in music. When I chose to go to college, I went to Evangel University in Springfield, Missouri. At this liberal arts school, I studied music education. This is also where I met my husband Vince. I got through five years of college, received a bachelors degree in K-12 music education, and got married in 1996.

                    Since getting married, I’ve taught in both public and private schools, covering every subject in elementary and teaching music to grades K-12. I took time off to stay home with my kids when they were young. Now, I love being back in the groove of sharing my knowledge and passion for music. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Vince and I live in Oakley with our kids Kayla, Angel, Gigi, and Ian. We’ve been through many things in our twenty-five years of marriage, but God has been our foundation from the very start. It’s nearly impossible for me to pick a “favorite” Bible verse because I love the entire Bible. One verse that I love to share is Matthew 6:26, because it keeps me from getting stressed out and reminds me that God is in control. *Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? -NIV Every child at Tabernacle is valuable, and I’m delighted to have the pleasure of teaching them.
