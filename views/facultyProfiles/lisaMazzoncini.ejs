                    I began working at Tabernacle School 24 years ago.  This year marks my 24 year!  I attended Heald Business College right out of high school and worked for a large engineering firm for 10 years until starting my family.  I have two daughters Stephanie and Michelle and began working for Tabernacle School when Michelle started kindergarten.  I was very fortunate to have been able to be at home with my children until they started school.    I feel blessed to be able to work in a school where God and Scripture are the center focus.

                    My husband Dan and I celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary this year.   My daughter Stephanie recently married and is an attorney in Danville.  Michelle also works in the legal field for a defense attorney in Walnut Creek.  I look forward to one day being a grandmother.  I enjoy traveling, reading, and walking the amazing trails in our area.

                    My favorite verse is Jeremiah 29:11 ” For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”
