                    I am very grateful to be part of the Tabernacle team.  This is an amazing school!  I have been teaching in Christian Education for 27 years.  This will be my 17th year at Tabernacle.   I grew up not too far from here, in Pacifica.  Although I miss seeing the ocean every day, I do not miss the fog.  Sunshine brought me to Concord!  I attended SFSU where I earned by BA in Liberal Studies and my MA in Education.  I have always wanted to be a teacher, and felt Godâ€™s calling to work in Christian Education.  I have seven children, ranging in ages from 39 -17 years.  Each one is unique and a blessing in my life.  I am also a Grandmother to three girls.  During my free-time, I enjoy family camping trips, reading a good book, and of course Starbucks!  I feel blessed each day to have an impact on young lives. Teaching them skills for the future, to be followers of Christ, and encouraging them to rely on God for all things is an awesome experience.
