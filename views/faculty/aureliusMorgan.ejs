                    Hello my name is Aurelius Morgan. I graduated from the University of Phoenix with a BS in Health and Human Services in 2016. I live in Antioch with my wife of 8 years Lauren and our now 3 year old daughter and 4 month old son. I have two dogs and enjoy taking family walks around the local trails. I have been a part of the Tabernacle family for 6 years. I enjoy working with all students and hope to impart the love of God to all of my students.
