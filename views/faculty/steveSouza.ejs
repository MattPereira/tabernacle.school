                    I graduated from The Mastersâ€™ University in 1975.  (Los Angeles Baptist College back then) I have been married to my wife, Sarah, for 39 years. We have three children, Nic, Heather, and Megan. Nic is married and lives in Brentwood. They have two children, Alice (9) and Gavin (6). Heather is married and lives in Fairfield. Megan is a stay- at- home mom.  She has two children, Cambry (8) attends Tabernacle and Levi (2).
