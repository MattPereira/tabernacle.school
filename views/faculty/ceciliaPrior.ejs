                    I have just started my 24th year at Tabernacle School. Before coming to Tabernacle I taught Pre-School for seventeen years. I attended Western Baptist College my first year of college, then received my B.A. at C.S.U.S. in Sacramento. I have been married for 34 years to Andrew Prior who teaches Jr. High Science here at Tabernacle. I have 27-year-old twins who attended Tabernacle from K â€“ 8th grade. I knew in my Jr. High years that I wanted to be a teacher. I love the little ones but when I had a chance to teach at Tabernacle I was excited and I have loved it from the first day. God has blessed my family and me over the years at Tabernacle. My favorite verse is found in Psalm 34:1 I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
