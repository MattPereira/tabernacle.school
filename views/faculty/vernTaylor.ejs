                    This will be my 30th year working at Tabernacle.  It is a privilege to work at a school that is centered on the Lord Jesus. I have a BA degree from Cal State Hayward, and a Masters of Education from Grand Canyon University. My family consists of my wife Gretchen, our daughter Lauren, and our triplets: Logan, Heidi and Rance.  All four of my children, as well as myself, are graduates of Tabernacle.

                    We have an amazing staff at Tabernacle, and I am blessed to be a part of such an amazing team.  There is a true sense of family here, and this is very evident the moment you step onto our campus.  We welcome you to come take a tour of our school.

                    Favorite verse is Ephesians 6:11, “Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.”
