                    Hello, my name is Alex Buckley and I have been working at Tabernacle for the past 9 years. I was born and raised in Concord and went to Tabernacle as a student, starting in first grade and finishing in 8th grade in 2008, and then attended De La Salle High School (Go Spartans!), where I played football for 4 years and baseball for 2. I also have a brother and sister who both attended Tabernacle from kindergarten to 8th grade, and De La Salle/Carondelet, where they both graduated as well. After graduating in 2012, I continued my education at DVC for 1 year and then moved down to San Diego to continue my education down there. About two years ago, after completing my education online, I earned my degree in Business Administration from Grand Canyon University. I currently teach PE and oversee all operations for the after school/summer daycare program. Along with teaching these students in this area of their education, I enjoy being able to coach some of the school sports including boysâ€™ soccer and volleyball.
