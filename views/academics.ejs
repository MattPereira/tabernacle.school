                We are thrilled to welcome you to Tabernacle Middle School, where we help our students navigate the early teen years and prepare to excel in high school and beyond. Throughout the middle school years, our students are challenged academically and grow in confidence as they explore their interests. We consider it an honor to partner with you in providing support and guidance for your children as they grow academically, spiritually, and athletically. We offer a strong list of academic and elective courses that meet our standard of excellence and help our students gain a solid academic footing in preparation for high school. Because of our high standards, our students regularly perform beyond grade level in national standard testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our middle school students have the opportunity to attend hands-on learning experiences as they go to a four-day outdoor education science camp in sixth grade. Students in the eighth grade take a week-long trip to Washington D.C. to visit the places they have learned about in our country’s history. Middle school students at Tabernacle have access to state-of-the-art computer and science labs, award winning school sports teams, and an enriching extended care program before and after school. Biblical truth is a part of everything we teach through daily Bible classes, weekly chapels, and classroom Biblical integration. We have our own chapel band lead us in worship during chapel time on Fridays and have guest speakers join our staff presenting God’s Word in the Bible.</p>

                    <p>As a school well known for maintaining academic excellence, Tabernacle School reviews all educational standards, both state and national. More importantly, we are committed to providing a Christian education to those we serve by forming and awakening faith in Jesus Christ in our students.</p>
                    <p>Many of the Common Core standards already have been in place at Tabernacle School. The Common Core calls for an increased emphasis on deeper understanding of underlying concepts in both the English Language Arts and Mathematics standards. Tabernacle School has long challenged students not just to memorize facts, but to go deeper, think critically, and demonstrate a higher level of understanding of content areas. Other Common Core Standards address only the minimum requirements and may be one or more grade levels below what we recognize as good teaching. We do not limit ourselves to the level of the standards but go beyond, based on our philosophy of learning and sound educational practices. In other words, Tabernacle School’s curriculum exceeds many Common Core Standards in age­ appropriate instruction and academic rigor. </p>
